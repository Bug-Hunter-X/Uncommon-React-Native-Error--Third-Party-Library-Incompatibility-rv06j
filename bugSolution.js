The solution depends on identifying the conflicting library. A common approach is to systematically comment out or remove third-party libraries to isolate the culprit.

Once identified:

1. **Find a React Native compatible alternative:** Search npm for similar libraries explicitly supporting React Native.
2. **Modify the library (advanced):** If no alternative is available, you may need to patch the library's code to resolve the compatibility issues, this usually involves understanding the library's codebase. This approach is time-consuming and risky if you do not fully understand the library's internals. 
3. **Use a compatibility layer:** Attempt to add a wrapper or helper function to bridge the gap between the library and React Native. This layer would handle the library's calls and translate them into suitable React Native counterparts.

Example (Illustrative solution):
```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import { CompatibleThirdPartyLibrary } from 'compatible-third-party-library'; // Replace with a compatible library

// ... later in your code ...
<CompatibleThirdPartyLibrary someProp="value" />
```
