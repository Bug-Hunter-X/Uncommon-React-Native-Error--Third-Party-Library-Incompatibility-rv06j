# React Native Bug: Third-Party Library Incompatibility

This repository demonstrates a common yet often tricky bug in React Native development: incompatibility with third-party libraries.  The bug manifests as unexpected behavior, crashes, or obscure error messages during runtime.

## Problem Description

The core issue arises from using a library designed for a broader JavaScript environment, which doesn't perfectly align with React Native's constraints.  This leads to unexpected errors, often making debugging a challenge.

## Solution

The provided solution focuses on identifying the problematic library and replacing it with a compatible alternative, if available. Otherwise, modifying or patching the existing library to ensure compatibility may be required.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the app using `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`).
4. Observe the error in the console or app behavior.  The provided `bugSolution.js` will show the corrected implementation.
