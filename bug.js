This error occurs when using a third-party library that isn't fully compatible with React Native's environment.  It might manifest as unexpected behavior, crashes, or runtime errors. The specific error message will vary greatly depending on the library and the nature of the incompatibility.

Example:
```javascript
import { SomeThirdPartyLibrary } from 'some-third-party-library';

// ... later in your code ...
<SomeThirdPartyLibrary someProp="value"/>
```

This might cause a runtime error if `some-third-party-library` relies on features or APIs unavailable in React Native, or if there's a conflict with other dependencies.
